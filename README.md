    Matching and allocation:
This is a simple Python script that helps match students to aid programs, allocate funds, and keep an audit trail of all actions. It uses SQLite to store students, aid programs, allocations, and logs. 
You can find suitable aid for a student or find students for a program, allocate funding while updating records, and cancel an allocation to refund funds if needed. It requires Python 3 and the built-in sqlite3 module.
